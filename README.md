# VEX AIM Websocket Python Client

 VEX AIM Websocket Python Client is a Python library designed to interact with the VEX AIM robot over WebSocket connections. It provides a high-level API to control the robot's movements, sensors, screen, sound, and other features from an external device.

## Features

- **WebSocket Communication**: Establish and manage WebSocket connections for commands, status updates, images, and audio.
- **Robot Control**: Move, turn, and stop the robot with precise control over speed and direction.
- **Sensor Access**: Retrieve data from the robot's inertial sensor, vision system, and touch screen.
- **Screen Interaction**: Draw shapes, display text, and show emojis on the robot's screen.
- **Sound Playback**: Play built-in or custom sounds and musical notes.
- **LED Control**: Set the color of the robot's LEDs.
- **AI Vision**: Detect objects, colors, codes, and AprilTags using the robot's built-in AI features.
- **Camera**: Streaming images from the robot's camera for implementing computer vision applications on the client side.
- **Event Handling**: Register callbacks for screen presses, crashes, and timers.
